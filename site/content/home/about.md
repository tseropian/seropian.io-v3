I am a seasoned software engineer delivering technology solutions, from startups to global organisations. I combine hands-on engineering with leading and scaling teams, ensuring code quality and developer growth. 

Throughout my career, I've launched products that their users have adopted, delivered a regulated health-tech product to market, and led teams that have improved delivery speed, reliability, and customer satisfaction. 

My focus is on helping organisations embrace new technologies to solve real-world problems.
