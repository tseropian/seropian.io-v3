description: Free 30min advisory session with senior software engineer Thomas Seropian

`Rubber ducking is a simple but effective technique used by programmers and problem-solvers to clarify their thoughts and find solutions to complex issues. By explaining your problem to an inanimate object - in this case, a rubber duck - you are able to organize your thoughts, identify underlying causes, and come up with new ideas.`
