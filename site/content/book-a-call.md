### Tech advisory call / Rubber ducking session
I'm offering free 30min _rubber-ducking_ sessions. Use the form below to book a slot. 



`
Rubber ducking is a simple but effective technique used by programmers and problem-solvers to clarify their thoughts and find solutions to complex issues. 
By explaining your problem to an inanimate object - in this case, a rubber duck - you are able to organize your thoughts, identify underlying causes, and come up with new ideas.
